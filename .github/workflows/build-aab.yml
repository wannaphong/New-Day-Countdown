      # Note: This builds an unsigned AAB. For production releases to Google Play,
      # you'll need to either:
      # 1. Configure signing in NewDayCountdown/app/build.gradle.kts with a keystore
      # 2. Sign the AAB manually after downloading it
      # 3. Add signing configuration to this workflow using GitHub secrets
